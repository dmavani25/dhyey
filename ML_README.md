# Detailed Design Document for Enhanced Document Retrieval System

## Objective

The objective is to create a document retrieval system that accurately identifies and ranks static HTML documents based on their relevance to a given search term (one word only), leveraging machine learning (ML) for advanced feature extraction and scoring. This system aims to provide efficient querying capabilities on an average local machine with an O(1) time complexity for retrieving results (or querying) by performing the pre-processing beforehand, and thus saving the computational time in querying mechanism.

## System Overview

The system comprises two primary phases: an enhanced preprocessing phase utilizing ML for in-depth document analysis and feature extraction, and a querying phase designed for fast retrieval of documents based on relevance scores. This document details the methodologies for relevance scoring, indexing, and the ML models employed in our framework.

## 1. Preprocessing Phase

### 1.1 HTML Parsing and Feature Extraction

- **Text Extraction**: Utilize a parsing API (assumed to be given to us) to extract plain text from HTML documents. This includes all textual content, ignoring scripts and non-visible elements.
- **Structural Analysis**: Extract HTML structural elements such as headings (H1, H2), bold text, links, and lists. These elements often indicate key sections and terms within the document, which can be of more importance and may better represent a given document.
- **Semantic Embedding Generation**: Use NLP models (e.g., BERT, GPT) to generate semantic embeddings from the extracted text. These embeddings capture the contextual meanings of phrases and terms within each document.
- **Structural Feature Extraction**: Assign weights to text based on HTML tags, recognizing that certain tags (e.g., H1, bold) may indicate higher importance of the enclosed text.

### 1.2 Document Scoring

#### Relevance Scoring Criteria

- **Term Frequency (TF)**: Calculate the frequency of each term within a document. Terms appearing more frequently are deemed more relevant.
- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Calculate the IDF for each term to determine its importance across the entire document corpus. Rare terms receive higher scores.
- **HTML Tag Weighting**: Assign additional weight to terms found within specific HTML tags (e.g., headers, bold text), indicating their increased relevance.

#### ML Model for Scoring

- **Training a Custom Model**: Train a supervised ML model to predict document relevance based on the features extracted above. This could involve:
  - A dataset of documents with manually labeled relevance scores for various terms.
  - Feature vectors composed of TF-IDF scores, semantic embeddings, and HTML tag weights.
  - A regression or classification model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or a simple neural network) that learns to predict the relevance of a document to specific terms based on these features.

### 1.3 Inverted Index Creation with Relevance Scores

- **Index Structure**: Create an inverted index where each entry consists of a term and a sorted list of documents containing that term. Each document in the list is associated with a relevance score derived from the ML model.
- **Serialization**: Serialize the inverted index into a format optimized for quick loading and access, ensuring the querying phase can retrieve documents efficiently.

## 2. Querying Phase

### 2.1 Index Loading

- Load the serialized inverted index into memory at the start of the querying phase.

### 2.2 Query Processing

- **Normalization**: Apply the same text normalization (stemming and stop word removal) to the search term as used in preprocessing.
- **Retrieval**: Instantly retrieve the pre-sorted list of documents and their relevance scores for the search term from the inverted index.

### 2.3 Filtering and Ranking

- **Threshold Application**: Filter the retrieved documents to include only those with relevance scores above a predetermined threshold. This ensures only the most relevant documents are presented.
- **Ranking**: Since the documents are pre-sorted by relevance score in the index, they are already in the correct order for presentation.

## Data Structures and Storage

- **Enhanced Inverted Index**: A key component of the system, it maps terms to documents and their relevance scores, enabling efficient O(1) querying.
- **Document Metadata**: Includes additional information required for ranking and presentation, such as document length, title, and URL.

## ML Models and Technologies

- **NLP Models for Semantic Analysis**: Pre-trained models like BERT or GPT, fine-tuned for the specific task of semantic embedding generation from document text.
- **ML Frameworks**: TensorFlow or PyTorch for developing and training custom models for document scoring, leveraging features extracted from text and HTML structure.

## System Requirements

- **Hardware**: An average local machine with enhanced capabilities (e.g., additional RAM for large indices, GPU for ML model training).
- **Software**: Requires NLP libraries for text processing, ML libraries for model training and inference, and custom software for managing the inverted index and handling queries.

## Potential Scalability and Optimization

- **Parallel Processing**: Utilize multi-threading or multiprocessing during the preprocessing phase for faster parsing, feature extraction, and model training.

## Conclusion

This design document outlines a sophisticated document retrieval system that uses machine learning to enhance the analysis, scoring, and indexing of HTML documents for relevance. By employing advanced NLP techniques and custom ML models, the system can accurately rank documents based on their relevance to search terms, ensuring efficient and effective retrieval on an average local machine.
